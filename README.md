### Additive Cipher (Caesar Cipher)

The Additive Cipher, also known as the Caesar Cipher, is one of the simplest encryption techniques. It involves shifting
each letter in the plaintext a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. Explore the Caesar Cipher and learn
how to encrypt and decrypt messages using this technique.

- Caesar Cipher Encryption
- Caesar Cipher Decryption

### Affine Cipher

The Affine Cipher is a type of substitution cipher that combines the Caesar Cipher with modular arithmetic. Discover how
the Affine Cipher works and how to perform encryption and decryption using its unique mathematical formula.

- Affine Cipher Overview
- Affine Cipher Encryption
- Affine Cipher Decryption

### Vigenere Cipher

TThe Vigenère Cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that builds upon the Caesar Cipher. Unlike the Caesar
Cipher, which uses a fixed shift value for each character, the Vigenère Cipher employs a keyword or passphrase to
determine the shift value for each character in the plaintext. This makes it significantly more secure than the simple
Caesar Cipher.

### Hill Cipher

The Hill Cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher that operates on multiple letters at once. Explore the mathematical
operations behind the Hill Cipher and practice encrypting and decrypting text.

### Substitution Permutation Networks

Substitution Permutation Networks (SPN) represent a modern approach to block ciphers and symmetric-key encryption. Dive
into the world of SPNs and understand their structure, as well as their role in modern cryptography.
